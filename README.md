=======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PabloVallejo/gillie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PabloVallejo/gillie)

Gillie is a JavaScript micro-framework that lets you easily structure your app using `models`, `views` and `handlers`. Gillie takes things from Backbone, jQuery and Underscore, it is very easy to set up and it's only dependency is jQuery.

## Quick start

Include jQuery, Gillie and your app scripts.

```html

<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/gillie.js"></script>
<script src="js/yourapp.js"></script>
```

## Documentation

Library documentation and examples can be found in the [project page](http://pablovallejo.github.io/gillie/)
